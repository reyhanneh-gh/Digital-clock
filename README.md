### 👩‍💻 About the Project  
This interactive card was developed as part of my journey into mastering JavaScript basics. It combines HTML structure, Tailwind styling, and JavaScript logic to create a dynamic user experience. The goal was to build something simple yet functional that allowed me to apply what I’ve recently learned—especially working with the DOM, handling mouse events, and updating content in real time.
